# Initial Experiment: Pipeline Profiling and Bottleneck Analysis

## Objective
Identify performance bottlenecks and resource inefficiencies in the current SayCan implementation to guide optimization efforts.

## Experiment Setup

### Data Collection
1. Instrument code to measure:
   - Model loading times
   - Inference times for each model
   - Data transfer times between components
   - Memory usage patterns
   - GPU utilization

2. Run standard tasks while collecting:
   - Component-wise timing data
   - Resource utilization metrics
   - Success/failure outcomes
   - End-to-end latency

### Test Scenarios
1. Single pick-and-place task
2. Sequential tasks (3-5 steps)
3. Continuous operation (10+ minutes)

## Expected Insights

### Performance Metrics
- Component-wise latency breakdown
- Memory usage patterns
- GPU utilization profiles
- Critical path analysis

### Bottleneck Identification
- Which components dominate latency?
- Where is memory being underutilized?
- What operations could be parallelized?
- Where could caching help?

### Initial Optimization Targets
Based on preliminary testing, we expect to find:
1. High latency in GPT-3 API calls
2. Inefficient GPU memory management
3. Unnecessary model reloading
4. Sequential operations that could be parallelized

## Implementation Plan
1. Add timing decorators to key functions
2. Implement resource monitoring
3. Create visualization dashboard
4. Run benchmark tasks
5. Analyze results and identify top optimization targets

This initial experiment will provide concrete data to guide our optimization efforts and establish baseline metrics for measuring improvements.
