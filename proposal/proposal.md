# Project Proposal: Optimizing and Enhancing SayCan for Practical Robotic Control

## Problem Statement
We aim to improve the open-source SayCan tabletop implementation by jointly optimizing its inference pipeline and enhancing its language-action grounding capabilities. The current implementation faces challenges with high latency due to sequential model inference and uses basic prompt engineering that doesn't leverage recent LLM advances. This dual optimization-enhancement approach is particularly relevant for making language-guided robotics more practical.

This is an interesting problem because:
1. It combines systems optimization with ML capability improvements
2. It addresses real-world deployment challenges for LLM-guided robotics
3. It has clear metrics for measuring success
4. The open-source implementation provides a concrete starting point

## Background Reading
Our primary sources will include:
* "Do As I Can, Not As I Say: Grounding Language in Robotic Affordances" (Ahn et al., 2022)
* "Chain of Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models" (Wei et al., 2022)
* "CLIPort: What and Where Pathways for Robotic Manipulation" (Shridhar et al., 2022)
* "Inferline: ML Inference Pipeline Composition Framework" (Crankshaw et al., 2020)

## Data
We will use the existing tabletop simulation environment with:
* Standard pick-and-place benchmark tasks
* Timing data for each component in the pipeline
* Resource utilization metrics
* Success/failure logs for different instruction types

## Proposed Method
We will improve the implementation through:

1. Pipeline optimization:
   * Add timing instrumentation to measure component latencies
   * Implement model response caching for repeated queries
   * Optimize CPU-GPU data transfers
   * Enable batched inference where possible

2. Language-action grounding enhancement:
   * Implement chain-of-thought prompting from the original paper
   * Add structured reasoning about physical constraints
   * Create templates for common failure cases
   * Track and utilize execution feedback

3. Integration:
   * Combine optimizations and enhancements systematically
   * Ensure optimizations don't compromise task success
   * Implement basic recovery strategies for common failures

## Evaluation
Qualitative evaluation:
* Visualization of pipeline bottlenecks
* Examples of enhanced reasoning through improved prompts
* Documentation of failure cases and recovery strategies
* Analysis of generated plans and execution paths

Quantitative metrics:
* End-to-end latency
* Memory usage and GPU utilization
* Task success rate across different instruction types
* Recovery success rate from common failures

We will evaluate on:
* Standard pick-and-place tasks from the original implementation
* Multi-step tasks requiring precise ordering
* Edge cases that test recovery strategies
* Continuous operation under varying loads

Our goal is to demonstrate:
1. 25-50% reduction in end-to-end latency
2. Improved success rate on complex instructions
3. Basic failure recovery capabilities
4. Scalable best practices for future improvements
