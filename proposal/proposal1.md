# Project Proposal: Optimizing SayCan's Pipeline for Real-Time Robotic Control

## Problem Statement
We aim to optimize the inference pipeline of the open-source SayCan implementation to achieve real-time performance for robotic control. The current system uses multiple large models (GPT-3, CLIP, CLIPort) in sequence, leading to high latency and computational overhead. This systems optimization challenge is particularly relevant as deploying large language models for robotic control requires balancing model performance with real-time constraints.

This is an interesting ML systems problem because:
1. It involves optimizing a multi-model inference pipeline
2. It requires balancing latency and accuracy tradeoffs
3. It has clear performance metrics for evaluation
4. The open-source implementation provides a concrete starting point

## Background Reading
Our primary sources will include:
- "Do As I Can, Not As I Say: Grounding Language in Robotic Affordances" (Ahn et al., 2022)
- "Inferline: ML Inference Pipeline Composition Framework" (Crankshaw et al., 2020)
- "Serve: A Systems Platform for ML Model Serving" (Ishakian et al., 2021)
- "Deep Learning Inference in Facebook Data Centers" (Park et al., 2018)

## Data
We will use the existing tabletop simulation environment with:
- Standard pick-and-place benchmark tasks
- Timing data for each component in the pipeline
- Resource utilization metrics
- End-to-end latency measurements

## Proposed Method
We will optimize the current implementation through:
1. Pipeline profiling and bottleneck identification:
   - Measure latency of each component
   - Track memory usage and GPU utilization
   - Identify critical path dependencies

2. Model optimization:
   - Implement model caching for repeated queries
   - Explore smaller alternatives to GPT-3 like GPT-2
   - Batch inference where possible

3. Resource management:
   - Implement efficient GPU memory management
   - Optimize CPU-GPU data transfers
   - Parallelize independent components

## Evaluation
Qualitative evaluation:
- Visualization of pipeline bottlenecks
- Resource utilization graphs
- Component-wise timing analysis

Quantitative metrics:
- End-to-end latency
- Memory usage
- GPU utilization
- Success rate maintenance
- Cost per inference

We will evaluate on:
- Standard pick-and-place tasks
- Continuous operation scenarios
- Variable load conditions
